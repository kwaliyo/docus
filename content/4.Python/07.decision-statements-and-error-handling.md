## Decision Statements and Error Handling in Python

Decision statements and error handling are fundamental to controlling program flow and managing unexpected issues in Python. Decision statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) allow conditional execution of code, while error handling (`try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`) ensures programs remain robust by catching and addressing exceptions.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this section, learners will be able to:

Use if, elif, and else to make decisions based on conditions.
Apply comparison, logical, and membership operators in decision statements.
Handle exceptions with try, except, else, and finally to manage errors.
Raise built-in and custom exceptions for specific scenarios.
Combine decision statements and error handling for robust program flow.

## Decision Statements

Decision statements evaluate conditions and execute code blocks based on their truth value. Python uses `if`, `elif` (else if), and `else` for this purpose.

### Syntax

```sh
if condition:
    # Code block if condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Code block if another_condition is True
else:
    # Code block if all conditions are False
```

> condition: A Boolean expression (e.g., x > 0).
> Indentation defines the code block.

1. Basic if Statement

```sh
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
# Output: You are an adult.
```

2. if-else Statement

```sh
temperature = 15
if temperature > 25:
    print("It's hot outside.")
else:
    print("It's cool outside.")
# Output: It's cool outside.
```

3. if-elif-else Statement

```sh
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: D or below")
# Output: Grade: B
```

Nested if Statements

```sh
number = 10
if number > 0:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print("Positive even number")
    else:
        print("Positive odd number")
else:
    print("Negative or zero")
# Output: Positive even number
```

### Operators in Decision Statements

Decision statements rely on operators:

- Comparison Operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
- Logical Operators: and, or, not
- Membership Operators: in, not in

Example with Operators

```sh
x = 5
y = 10
if x > 0 and y < 15:
    print("Both conditions met")
# Output: Both conditions met

name = "Alice"
if "l" in name:
    print("Name contains 'l'")
# Output: Name contains 'l'
```

### Ternary Operator (Conditional Expression)

A concise alternative to simple if-else:

```sh
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(status)  # Output: Adult
```

# Error Handling

Errors (exceptions) occur when code encounters unexpected situations (e.g., division by zero, file not found). Python uses try, except, else, and finally to handle exceptions gracefully.

Syntax

```sh
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
except ExceptionType as e:
    # Handle specific exception
else:
    # Runs if no exception occurs
finally:
    # Always runs, regardless of exception
```

1. Basic try-except

```sh
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
# Output: Cannot divide by zero!
```

2. Multiple Exceptions

```sh
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 100 / number
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid integer!")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
# Output depends on input:
# "abc" → Please enter a valid integer!
# "0" → Cannot divide by zero!
```

3. Catching All Exceptions
   Use Exception to catch any exception (use cautiously):

```sh
try:
    file = open("missing.txt", "r")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
# Output: An error occurred: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'missing.txt'
```

4. else Clause
   Runs if no exception occurs:

```sh
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input!")
else:
    print(f"You entered: {number}")
# Input "5" → You entered: 5
# Input "abc" → Invalid input!
```

5. finally Clause
   Executes regardless of exceptions, useful for cleanup:

```sh
try:
    file = open("data.txt", "w")
    file.write("Hello")
except IOError:
    print("File error!")
finally:
    file.close()
    print("File closed.")
# Output: File closed. (and "Hello" in data.txt if successful)
```

### Raising Exceptions

Use raise to trigger exceptions manually:

```sh
age = -5
if age < 0:
    raise ValueError("Age cannot be negative!")
# Output: ValueError: Age cannot be negative!
```

### Custom Exceptions

Define custom exception classes:

```sh
class NegativeNumberError(Exception):
    pass

def check_positive(number):
    if number < 0:
        raise NegativeNumberError("Number must be positive!")
    return number

try:
    check_positive(-3)
except NegativeNumberError as e:
    print(e)
# Output: Number must be positive!
```

### Decision Statements and Error Handling Together

Combine for robust code:

```sh
try:
    value = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))
    if value <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Number must be positive!")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
else:
    print(f"Success: {value}")
# Input "5" → Success: 5
# Input "-2" → Error: Number must be positive!
# Input "abc" → Error: invalid literal for int()...
```

### Common Use Cases

- User Input Validation:

```sh
try:
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    if age < 0 or age > 120:
        raise ValueError("Invalid age!")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
else:
    print(f"Age accepted: {age}")
```

- File Operations:

```sh
try:
    with open("config.txt", "r") as file:
        data = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Config file not found!")
else:
    print(f"Data: {data}")
```

- Resource Management:

```sh
resource = None
try:
    resource = allocate_resource()
    if not resource:
        raise RuntimeError("Resource unavailable!")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(e)
finally:
    if resource:
        release_resource()
        print("Resource released.")
```
