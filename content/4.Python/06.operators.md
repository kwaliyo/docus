# Operators


## Learning Outcomes:

By the end of this topic, students will be able to:

- Define what operators are in Python and explain their role in performing operations on variables and values.
- Identify the different categories of operators available in Python (e.g., arithmetic, assignment, comparison, etc.).
- Apply operators in Python code to manipulate data and solve problems.
- Understand operator precedence and how it affects the evaluation of expressions.

## Operators

Python language supports several types of operators. In this section, we will focus on few of them.

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Let us take = as an example. Equal sign in mathematics shows that two values are equal, however in Python it means we are storing a value in a certain variable and we call it assignment or a assigning value to a variable. The table below shows the different types of python assignment operators, taken from [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp).

![Assignment Operators](/images/assignment_operators.png)

Example: Arithmetic Assignment Operators

```sh
# Starting value
x = 10

# Addition assignment
x += 5  # x = x + 5
print(x)  # Output: 15

# Subtraction assignment
x -= 3  # x = x - 3
print(x)  # Output: 12

# Multiplication assignment
x *= 2  # x = x * 2
print(x)  # Output: 24

# Division assignment
x /= 4  # x = x / 4
print(x)  # Output: 6.0 (result is a float)

# Modulus assignment
x %= 2  # x = x % 2
print(x)  # Output: 0.0

# Floor division assignment
x = 7
x //= 2  # x = x // 2
print(x)  # Output: 3

# Exponentiation assignment
x **= 3  # x = x ** 3
print(x)  # Output: 27
```

### Arithmetic Operators:

- Addition(+): a + b
- Subtraction(-): a - b
- Multiplication(_): a _ b
- Division(/): a / b
- Modulus(%): a % b
- Floor division(//): a // b
- Exponentiation(**): a ** b

**Example:Integers**

```sh
# Arithmetic Operations in Python
# Integers

print('Addition: ', 1 + 2)        # 3
print('Subtraction: ', 2 - 1)     # 1
print('Multiplication: ', 2 * 3)  # 6
print ('Division: ', 4 / 2)       # 2.0  Division in Python gives floating number
print('Division: ', 6 / 2)        # 3.0
print('Division: ', 7 / 2)        # 3.5
print('Division without the remainder: ', 7 // 2)   # 3,  gives without the floating number or without the remaining
print ('Division without the remainder: ',7 // 3)   # 2
print('Modulus: ', 3 % 2)         # 1, Gives the remainder
print('Exponentiation: ', 2 ** 3) # 9 it means 2 * 2 * 2
```

**Example:Floats**

```sh
# Floating numbers
print('Floating Point Number, PI', 3.14)
print('Floating Point Number, gravity', 9.81)
```

**Example:Complex numbers**

```sh
# Complex numbers
print('Complex number: ', 1 + 1j)
print('Multiplying complex numbers: ',(1 + 1j) * (1 - 1j))
```

Let's declare a variable and assign a number data type. I am going to use single character variable but remember do not develop a habit of declaring such types of variables. Variable names should be all the time mnemonic.

**Example:**

```sh
# Declaring the variable at the top first

a = 3 # a is a variable name and 3 is an integer data type
b = 2 # b is a variable name and 3 is an integer data type

# Arithmetic operations and assigning the result to a variable
total = a + b
diff = a - b
product = a * b
division = a / b
remainder = a % b
floor_division = a // b
exponential = a ** b

# I should have used sum instead of total but sum is a built-in function - try to avoid overriding built-in functions
print(total) # if you do not label your print with some string, you never know where the result is coming from
print('a + b = ', total)
print('a - b = ', diff)
print('a * b = ', product)
print('a / b = ', division)
print('a % b = ', remainder)
print('a // b = ', floor_division)
print('a ** b = ', exponentiation)
```

**Example:**

```sh
print('== Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus ==')

# Declaring values and organizing them together
num_one = 3
num_two = 4

# Arithmetic operations
total = num_one + num_two
diff = num_two - num_one
product = num_one * num_two
div = num_two / num_one
remainder = num_two % num_one

# Printing values with label
print('total: ', total)
print('difference: ', diff)
print('product: ', product)
print('division: ', div)
print('remainder: ', remainder)
```

Let us start start connecting the dots and start making use of what we already know to calculate (area, volume,density, weight, perimeter, distance, force).

**Example:**

```sh
# Calculating area of a circle
radius = 10                                 # radius of a circle
area_of_circle = 3.14 * radius ** 2         # two * sign means exponent or power
print('Area of a circle:', area_of_circle)

# Calculating area of a rectangle
length = 10
width = 20
area_of_rectangle = length * width
print('Area of rectangle:', area_of_rectangle)

# Calculating a weight of an object
mass = 75
gravity = 9.81
weight = mass * gravity
print(weight, 'N')                         # Adding unit to the weight

# Calculate the density of a liquid
mass = 75 # in Kg
volume = 0.075 # in cubic meter
density = mass / volume # 1000 Kg/m^3

```

### Comparison Operators

In programming we compare values, we use comparison operators to compare two values. We check if a value is greater or less or equal to other value. The following table shows Python comparison operators which was taken from [w3shool](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp).

![Comparison Operators](/images/comparison_operators.png)
**Example: Comparison Operators**
Examples:

```sh
print(3 > 2)     # True, because 3 is greater than 2
print(3 >= 2)    # True, because 3 is greater than 2
print(3 < 2)     # False,  because 3 is greater than 2
print(2 < 3)     # True, because 2 is less than 3
print(2 <= 3)    # True, because 2 is less than 3
print(3 == 2)    # False, because 3 is not equal to 2
print(3 != 2)    # True, because 3 is not equal to 2
print(len('mango') == len('avocado'))  # False
print(len('mango') != len('avocado'))  # True
print(len('mango') < len('avocado'))   # True
print(len('milk') != len('meat'))      # False
print(len('milk') == len('meat'))      # True
print(len('tomato') == len('potato'))  # True
print(len('python') > len('dragon'))   # False


# Comparing something gives either a True or False

print('True == True: ', True == True)
print('True == False: ', True == False)
print('False == False:', False == False)
```

In addition to the above comparison operator Python uses:

- _is_: Returns true if both variables are the same object(x is y)
- _is not_: Returns true if both variables are not the same object(x is not y)
- _in_: Returns True if the queried list contains a certain item(x in y)
- _not in_: Returns True if the queried list doesn't have a certain item(x in y)

Examples:

```sh
print('1 is 1', 1 is 1)                   # True - because the data values are the same
print('1 is not 2', 1 is not 2)           # True - because 1 is not 2
print('A in Asabeneh', 'A' in 'Asabeneh') # True - A found in the string
print('B in Asabeneh', 'B' in 'Asabeneh') # False - there is no uppercase B
print('coding' in 'coding for all') # True - because coding for all has the word coding
print('a in an:', 'a' in 'an')      # True
print('4 is 2 ** 2:', 4 is 2 ** 2)   # True
```

### Logical Operators

Unlike other programming languages python uses keywords _and_, _or_ and _not_ for logical operators. Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

![Logical Operators](/images/logical_operators.png)

Examples:

```sh
print(3 > 2 and 4 > 3) # True - because both statements are true
print(3 > 2 and 4 < 3) # False - because the second statement is false
print(3 < 2 and 4 < 3) # False - because both statements are false
print('True and True: ', True and True)
print(3 > 2 or 4 > 3)  # True - because both statements are true
print(3 > 2 or 4 < 3)  # True - because one of the statements is true
print(3 < 2 or 4 < 3)  # False - because both statements are false
print('True or False:', True or False)
print(not 3 > 2)     # False - because 3 > 2 is true, then not True gives False
print(not True)      # False - Negation, the not operator turns true to false
print(not False)     # True
print(not not True)  # True
print(not not False) # False

```

### Identity Operators

Identity operators check if two variables refer to the same object in memory. Two variables might have the same value but still be different objects, or they might be the same object with the same memory address.

> is: Returns True if both variables refer to the same object.,<br/>
> is not: Returns True if both variables do not refer to the same object.

Example:

```sh
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
c = [1, 2, 3]

print(a is b)   # True (same object)
print(a is c)   # False (different objects with same values)
print(a is not c)  # True
```

Example: Identity Operators with Numbers

```sh
# Small integers are cached in Python, so they share the same object
a = 5
b = 5

print(a is b)      # True - Python caches small integers, so a and b refer to the same object
print(a == b)      # True - They also have the same value
print(a is not b)  # False - They are the same object

# Larger numbers might not be cached
x = 1000
y = 1000

print(x is y)      # False - Larger numbers are not necessarily cached, so different objects
print(x == y)      # True - They have the same value
print(x is not y)  # True - They are different objects
```

Example: Identity Operators with Lists

```sh
# Lists with the same values but different objects
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
list3 = list1  # Assigning list1 to list3 (same object)

print(list1 is list2)      # False - Different objects, even though values are the same
print(list1 == list2)      # True - Same values
print(list1 is list3)      # True - Same object (same memory location)
print(list1 is not list2)  # True - They are not the same object
```

Example: Identity Operators with Strings

```sh
# Strings are interned (cached) for small, simple strings
str1 = "hello"
str2 = "hello"

print(str1 is str2)      # True - Python interns small strings, so same object
print(str1 == str2)      # True - Same value
print(str1 is not str2)  # False - They are the same object

# Longer or constructed strings might not be interned
str3 = "hello world!"
str4 = "hello world!"

print(str3 is str4)      # False - Not necessarily the same object
print(str3 == str4)      # True - Same value
```

### Membership Operators

Membership operators test if a sequence (e.g., string, list, tuple) contains a certain value.

> in: Returns True if the value is present.<br/>
> not in: Returns True if the value is absent.
> Examples:

```sh
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("banana" in fruits)    # True
print("grape" not in fruits) # True
```

Example: Membership Operators with Strings

```sh
# Checking characters in a string
text = "Hello, Python!"
print('H' in text)       # True - 'H' is in the string
print('z' in text)       # False - 'z' is not in the string
print('Python' in text)  # True - 'Python' is a substring
print('Java' not in text)  # True - 'Java' is not a substring
print('o' not in text)   # False - 'o' is in the string
```

Example: Membership Operators with Lists

```sh
# Checking elements in a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

print('apple' in fruits)      # True - 'apple' is in the list
print('grape' in fruits)      # False - 'grape' is not in the list
print('banana' not in fruits) # False - 'banana' is in the list
print('grape' not in fruits)  # True - 'grape' is not in the list
```

Example: Membership Operators with Tuples

```sh
# Checking elements in a tuple
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

print(3 in numbers)     # True - 3 is in the tuple
print(6 in numbers)     # False - 6 is not in the tuple
print(1 not in numbers) # False - 1 is in the tuple
print(7 not in numbers) # True - 7 is not in the tuple
```

Example: Membership Operators with Sets

```sh
# Checking elements in a set
colors = {'red', 'blue', 'green'}

print('red' in colors)      # True - 'red' is in the set
print('yellow' in colors)   # False - 'yellow' is not in the set
print('blue' not in colors) # False - 'blue' is in the set
```

Example: Membership Operators with Dictionaries

```sh
# Checking keys in a dictionary (only checks keys, not values)
person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}

print('name' in person)    # True - 'name' is a key
print('Alice' in person)   # False - 'Alice' is a value, not a key
print('age' not in person) # False - 'age' is a key
print('gender' not in person)  # True - 'gender' is not a key
```

### Operator Precedence

> Operator precedence in Python defines the order in which operations are performed when an expression contains multiple operators. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence. If operators have the same precedence, Python evaluates the expression from left to right (except for the exponentiation operator \*\*, which is right-associative). Parentheses can be used to override the default precedence and force a specific evaluation order.

### Operator Precedence Table

> Same Precedence: Operators on the same row are evaluated left to right, except for \*\* (right-associative).
