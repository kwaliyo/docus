### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this section, students will be able to:

- Understand the purpose and syntax of for and while loops in Python.
- Use for loops to iterate over sequences and ranges effectively.
- Implement while loops for condition-based repetition.
- Apply break, continue, and else to control loop execution.
- Write nested loops to handle multi-dimensional data or complex tasks.




# Loops in Python

Loops in Python allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition or over a sequence of items. Python provides two primary loop constructs: `for` loops and `while` loops. These are essential for iterating over data structures, performing repetitive tasks, and controlling program flow.

## For Loops

The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string, set, dictionary) or any iterable object. It’s particularly useful when you know the number of iterations or want to process each item in a collection.

### Syntax

```sh
for variable in iterable:
    # Code block to execute
```

> variable: A temporary variable that takes the value of each item in the iterable.<br />
> iterable: An object that can be iterated over (e.g., list, range).

Examples
Iterating Over a List

```sh
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# Output:
# apple
# banana
# orange
```

Using range()
The range() function generates a sequence of numbers, often used with for loops.

```sh
for i in range(5):  # 0 to 4
    print(i)
# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
```

range(start, stop, step): Customizable range with start (inclusive), stop (exclusive), and step (increment).

```sh
for i in range(1, 10, 2):  # 1 to 9, step 2
    print(i)
# Output:
# 1
# 3
# 5
# 7
# 9
```

Iterating Over a String

```sh
word = "Python"
for char in word:
    print(char)
# Output:
# P
# y
# t
# h
# o
# n
```

Iterating Over a Dictionary

```sh
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
for key in person:
    print(f"{key}: {person[key]}")
# Output:
# name: Alice
# age: 25

# Using items() for key-value pairs
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
# Output:
# name: Alice
# age: 25
```

## While Loops

The while loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is True. It’s useful when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a dynamic condition.
![While loop in python](/images/while-loop-in-python.jpg)
Syntax

```sh
while condition:
    # Code block to execute
```

condition: A Boolean expression evaluated before each iteration.
Examples
Basic While Loop

```sh
Copy
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
```

With User Input

```sh
number = 0
while number >= 0:
    number = int(input("Enter a number (negative to stop): "))
    print(f"You entered: {number}")
# Output depends on input, e.g.:
# Enter a number (negative to stop): 5
# You entered: 5
# Enter a number (negative to stop): -1
# You entered: -1
```

## Loop Control Statements

Python provides statements to modify loop behavior:

1. break
   Exits the loop immediately, regardless of the condition.

```sh
for i in range(10):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
```

2. continue
   Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.

```sh
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 3
# 4
```

3. else
   Executes a block of code if the loop completes normally (without break).

```sh
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed")
# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# Loop completed


# With break
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed")
# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
```

### Nested Loops

Loops can be nested to process multi-dimensional data or perform complex iterations.

```sh
# Simple Multiplication Table
for i in range(1, 11):
    for j in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{i} x {j} = {i * j}")
    print()  # Add a new line after each row

```

### Common Use Cases

Processing Sequences:

```sh
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
total = 0
for num in numbers:
    total += num
print(total)  # Output: 6
```

Repeating Until Condition:

```sh
attempts = 3
while attempts > 0:
    print(f"Attempts left: {attempts}")
    attempts -= 1
# Output:
# Attempts left: 3
# Attempts left: 2
# Attempts left: 1
```

Searching:

```sh
numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1]
target = 8
for num in numbers:
    if num == target:
        print(f"Found {target}")
        break
# Output: Found 8
```

### Loops and Operators

Loops often work with operators:

- Comparison Operators: Used in while conditions (e.g., <, >).
- Assignment Operators: Update variables (e.g., +=).
- Membership Operators: Check presence in iterables (e.g., in).

```sh
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
for num in numbers:
    if num > 0:
        print(num)
# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
```
